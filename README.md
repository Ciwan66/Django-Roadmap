# Django Roadmap
    this roadmap focus on how the backend works 
    and how could you become a django developer 
    with a very solid experince on how the backend works.

<br>

### The goal of this roadmap is :
1. Learn backend `fundamentals`
2. Learn `Django`
3. Learn the needed requirements as a `junior django developer`


<br>

## Let's Starting 🔥


```
Before starting, I add the titels to you with the resources i learn it from, 
the resources is optional for listening from it or choose another resource to learn from it.
feel free to choose 😊 
```

<!-- ### I Dvided the roadmap into three parts
1. `beginner:` focus on how to build a python and how to test and calc the performance of your code. -->

<br>


# Beginner

1. `Python Basics`
    - Arabic : [Osama Elzero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAyE_gei5d18qkfIe-Z8mocs) from 1 -> 80 (recommend 3 or 4 videos per day )
    - English [Free Codecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbnqBxcdjVGgT3uVR10bzTEB)

### Tasks

```
1. calculator : calc this operation [+,-,*,/,//,%] in the user inputs numbers
2. todo system : simple todo system for create, read and delete the tasks from user.
```


2. `Python OOP`
    - Arabic : [Osama Elzero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUgz8T_NoattU54gGARPXPmmawQNl-1_T)
    - English : [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbMDCwVm63M)


### Tasks

```
1. Write a Python program to create a person class. 
Include attributes like name, country and date of birth. 
Implement a method to determine the person's age and 
a method to print the user name, and method to print the user country.


2. Implement inheritance principle in the task 1

3. Implement Polymorphism in task 2

4. Create an abstract class , and write abstracted methods on it.
```


3. `Django`
    - [What is Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_p4ZyAYyaY&pp=ygUOd2hhdCBpcyBkamFuZ28%3D)
    - [Django Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFkzKxQz9gE)
    - [Starts in Django](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2z1gXAKH9c3XUn2HYMWRbAon4z6AQ4CL) 1 -> 36

4. `Github` : 
- - [Arabic Github Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6G-J54vgKc&pp=ygUOZ2l0aHViIGJpZ2RhdGE%3D) -> Highly Recommended

### Tasks
```
Create todo system:
    1. user can register
    2. user can login
    4. user can logout
    5. each user has own Todos
    6. user can add todo
    7. user can delete his todo
    8. user can update his todo
    9. user can change the todo state to done

Todo Model : 
    - user [ForigenKey]
    - text [TextField]
    - is_done [BoolField]
    - created_at [DateTimeField]

Notes :
    -> not matter how the design looks like, 
        the important thing is the backend server and the system logic

    -> After you finish this task push it in your github account
```

### What After that ?

You now are qualified to start to search for work as a junior django developer.
and for more information u need at least to read about these topics to imporve 
your skills more and more :

1. Microservices
2. System Design
3. Dive into dbs especially PostgreSQL.
4. get invloved more in Operations Systems especially in linux
5. read more about networks and how these protocols communicate with each others 
6. Try to read books in the teach stack.
7. Try to get invlovled with django community and python comunity whith their blogs and groups 
8. Netwroking with other peopels has a good experince in the field and learn from their experince.
9. nice to ask then search on the internet.
10. it's very cool to build your own projects with your own ideas.

### **Finally** ❤️
> what i want to say that the software world has no limit and there is more and more things you must to learn and on this big ocean of informations u must not to stop to learning and searching.
